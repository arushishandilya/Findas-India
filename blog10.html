                <p class="text-muted mb-4"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>May 7, 2023</p>

               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">Here are the reasons why you need to take charge of your
                            financial life as early as possible. We have been working in this area of financial
                            planning, since the year 1999 with our experience of so many years, we have certain
                            observations about people on how they deal with their financial lives before they come to
                            us. people are very passive, or casual about their financial management, after they have
                            earned the money that they wanted to earn.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">The second observation is most of our education that we
                            take, irrespective of whether you are an engineer or a doctor or a business owner, gives us
                            only one skill. The education is designed in such a way that it gives us a common skill.
                            That is how to make money, or how to earn money. Unfortunately, our educational system fails
                            to deal with an abundance of the money cycle, and that is what to do with the money. Once
                            you have earned it such that you are able to live the life that you love.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">The third observation is that most people deal with
                            their financial management on their own, they follow what we call the to eat yourself method
                            to deal with their finances, just like when you have a health issue you go to a doctor, or
                            if you have a legal issue you go to an advocate, you need to go to a financial expert, when
                            you need to deal with financial management in your life. Unfortunately, in India, just about
                            3 to 4% of the people, consult a financial expert in view of these three observations.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">We are going to now discuss why you need to take charge
                            of your financial life as early as possible.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">• The first reason why you need to take charge of
                                your financial life as early as possible, is that the days when the government used to
                                take care of your old age deeds are gone. There was a time in this country. When once
                                you took up a job, the government would take care of everything. Till you are alive, but
                                this is no longer to. It is only you who has to provide for all your financial needs.
                                Plus, in this age of nuclear families, there is now no guarantee that your children
                                would be around to support you in your old age. Unfortunately, the truth of life is जबतक
                                आपके पास पैसे है, लोग पूछेंगे आप कैसे है!! So you need to have money on your side.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">• The second reason why you need to take charge of
                                your financial life is that this market of financial products is full of sellers.
                                Everyone is busy selling something to you without any consideration to what you actually
                                need, or what you actually want these sailors come in every from right from the young
                                boys and girls that try to sell you the credit card inside the malls while shopping to
                                the cashiers in the bank, who tried to fool you into buying mutual funds, and our old
                                friend the insurance agent who is always around the corner and carrying the best policy
                                in the world, which is closing soon, so he is in a hurry to sell you that policy, the
                                sellers are often our close acquaintances and avoiding them is a task in itself. It is,
                                however, in your favour to identify the difference between a seller, and a counselor,
                                the only agenda that a seller has is to sell his product to you. It doesn’t really
                                bother. Whether you need it or you don’t need it. However, the agenda of a good
                                counselor is first to create a tailor made solution for you, that works out for you, or
                                a period of time. And also, it is his duty to view the freedom to choose which is the
                                best choice for you.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-3">• The reason number three is that, because of the
                                improvement in medical sciences, all of us will most probably live longer than we
                                imagined. There is a certain pattern that we commonly see in the lives of majority of
                                the people in the initial years, when people are young, and just begin to earn, they
                                also take up loans, and end up paying EMI this EMI form a major part of their monthly
                                outflow this early stage is what we call the EMI and the liquidity crisis, as one
                                approaches the middle age, the thoughts about promotions, or career progression, start
                                crowding their minds, the people in this stage, normally would spend more time at their
                                jobs or take up part time education programs, in order to increase their market value.
                                This stage is usually followed by an urge of freedom and entrepreneurship.
                                Unfortunately, the path to successful entrepreneurship is filled with challenges that
                                one may not be mentally as well as financially, prepared to face.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-4">That is why the failure rate of small businesses is very
                            high, and at times, scary. This is then followed by the last and final stage of one’s
                            career. This is the time when people start wondering whether the money they have made so
                            far, will last them for a lifetime. Maybe the money will last a lifetime. You don’t know for
                            sure. Unless you have taken some time off. In the early years of your life, and made it a
                            point to work on this very important area of your life, my observation is most people are so
                            busy earning the money that they are earning, they hardly have any time left. Look, actively
                            at their financial management, although most of us realize that active financial management
                            is an important area. It is never urgent for most of us, it is just that one thing to be
                            done, sometime in life, however, let me tell you one thing very clearly at this point of
                            time living with the regret of decisions not made on time is the worst situation, you can
                            hope for, to get yourself in life, so it is time to stop and think, are you consuming most
                            of your energy in, earning the money that you earn, who is managing your financial life.
                            Does he or she have the required expertise, and the experiential knowledge to manage your
                            money, who will know your financial goals.</p>             
               <p class="text-secondary mt-4">Do you have a strategy or a plan on how you’re going to
                            reach these goals. It is time that you give a hard thought to the fact that what is your
                            confidence level that you will live an abundant life and the life that you love. I hope that
                            you realize that taking charge of your financial life is not something to be postponed. It
                            is a very serious thing, so do it now before it’s too late. If you need any assistance in
                            dealing with this important area of your life, we add fitness would be more than happy to
