                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Financial freedom is a goal that many people strive for,
                            and for good reason. Achieving financial freedom means having the ability to live the life
                            you want without worrying about money. It means having enough money to cover your basic
                            needs, as well as your wants and desires, without having to rely on a job or someone else
                            for financial support.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Here are some tips to help you achieve
                            financial freedom:</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Create a budget and stick to it: A budget is a
                                plan for your money that helps you control your spending. Start by tracking your income
                                and expenses for a few months to get an idea of where your money is going. Then, create
                                a budget that includes your monthly expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, food,
                                transportation, and savings. Stick to your budget as much as possible, but also allow
                                for some flexibility.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Reduce your debt: Debt can be a major obstacle to
                                achieving financial freedom. Start by paying off high-interest debt, such as credit
                                cards or personal loans, as quickly as possible. You can also consider consolidating
                                your debt into a single payment with a lower interest rate.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Save for emergencies: Unexpected expenses can
                                quickly derail your finances. Make sure you have an emergency fund to cover unexpected
                                expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Aim to save at least 3-6
                                months’ worth of living expenses in your emergency fund.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Invest for the future: Investing can help you
                                grow your wealth over time. Consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks,
                                bonds, and other assets that align with your long-term financial goals.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Live below your means: Living below your means is
                                one of the most important steps to achieving financial freedom. It means spending less
                                than you earn and avoiding lifestyle inflation. By living below your means, you can save
                                more money and invest in your future.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Set financial goals: Setting financial goals can
                                help you stay motivated and focused on achieving financial freedom. Write down your
                                goals and create a plan to achieve them. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable,
                                achievable, relevant, and time-bound.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Achieving financial freedom is not easy, but it is
                            possible with hard work, discipline, and dedication. By following these tips, you can take
                            control of your finances and work towards a more secure and prosperous future.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">Which is a better tax saving option ? ELSS or PPF
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">When it comes to tax saving investments in India, two
                            popular options are Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Equity-Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS)
                            mutual funds. Both PPF and ELSS investments offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the
                            Income Tax Act, 1961. However, there are some significant differences between the two that
                            investors should consider before making a decision.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">PPF is a government-backed investment scheme that offers
                            a fixed rate of interest and has a lock-in period of 15 years. The minimum annual investment
                            in PPF is Rs. 500, and the maximum is Rs. 1.5 lakh. The interest earned on PPF is tax-free,
                            and the investment qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80C. Currently PPF pays an
                            annual interest rate of 7.1%.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">On the other hand, ELSS mutual funds are equity-oriented
                            mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks. ELSS has a lock-in period of three years, and
                            the minimum investment is Rs. 500. There is no maximum limit for investment in ELSS, and
                            investors can invest as much as they want. The returns on ELSS are market-linked and not
                            fixed. Typically ELSS schemes deliver double digit returns over a investment period of 7
                            years or more.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">To compare the investment and returns data for the last
                            20 years, let's take a look at the historical performance of PPF and ELSS mutual funds.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">From 2003 to 2022, the interest rate on PPF varied from
                            8.0% to 7.1%. Over the same period, the average annual return of ELSS mutual funds was
                            around 12%. It is important to note that past performance does not guarantee future returns,
                            and investors should always consult with a financial advisor before making investment
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">As an investment firm with over 23 years of experience,
                            FINDAS can help clients invest in ELSS mutual funds. We have a team of experienced
                            professionals who have been through good and bad times in the market, and we have a proven
                            track record of delivering consistent returns to our clients. Our expertise in market
                            analysis, portfolio management, and risk management can help our clients make informed

                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, while PPF is a safe and secure investment
                            option, ELSS mutual funds offer higher returns over the long term. Investors should consider
                            their risk tolerance, investment goals, and financial situation before choosing between the
                            two options. As an experienced investment firm, FINDAS can help clients invest in ELSS
                            mutual funds and achieve their financial objectives.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing in mutual funds is an easy and effective way
                            to grow your wealth. Mutual funds have been gaining popularity in India over the past decade
                            due to their simplicity, flexibility, and low investment requirements. In this blog post, we
                            will discuss the importance and ease of investing in mutual funds in India, the types of
                            mutual funds available, and the history and returns generated by mutual funds in India.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Importance of Investing in Mutual Funds
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Mutual funds are a great way to invest your money and
                            diversify your portfolio. They offer several benefits, including professional management,
                            diversification, liquidity, affordability, and tax benefits. Professional fund managers
                            manage mutual funds, making them ideal for investors who lack the time, knowledge, or
                            expertise to manage their own investments. Additionally, mutual funds are diversified, which
                            means they invest in a range of securities, reducing the risk of losing your entire
                            investment in one stock.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Ease of Investing in Mutual Funds</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing in mutual funds is a straightforward process.
                            You can buy mutual funds online or through a broker. Mutual funds are also affordable, with
                            investment minimums as low as INR 100. Mutual funds are also flexible, allowing you to buy
                            or sell units whenever you need to without any exit load or penalty.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Types of Mutual Funds Available</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">There are several types of mutual funds available in
                            India, including equity funds, debt funds, hybrid funds, and international funds. Equity
                            funds invest primarily in stocks, offering higher returns but also higher risk. Debt funds
                            invest in fixed-income securities like bonds and offer more stable returns. Hybrid funds
                            combine equity and debt instruments, offering a balance between returns and risk.
                            International funds invest in foreign markets and offer diversification beyond Indian
                            markets.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #000;" class="mt-3">History and Returns Generated by Mutual
                            Funds in India</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Mutual funds have a long history in India, with the
                            first mutual fund launched in 1964. Since then, mutual funds have grown significantly, with
                            assets under management (AUM) increasing from INR 1.97 lakh crore in 1998 to INR 40 lakh
                            crore in 2022. Mutual funds have generated impressive returns, with some equity funds
                            providing returns of up to 12-20% over the past decade.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, investing in mutual funds is an important
                            and easy way to grow your wealth. With several types of mutual funds available and
                            impressive returns generated by mutual funds in India, investors can choose the right mutual
                            funds to meet their investment objectives and financial goals. However, before investing in
                            mutual funds, it is important to understand your risk tolerance and investment horizon and
                            consult a financial advisor to make informed investment decisions.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">Benefits of investing early in life</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing early in life is just as important in India as
                            it is anywhere else in the world. The benefits of investing early can be significant and can
                            help you achieve your financial goals.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Compounding Interest -</strong> Compounding
                            interest is just as powerful in India as it is anywhere else. The longer you let your
                            investments grow, the more substantial your returns will be. This is particularly important
                            in India, where the economy is growing rapidly, and the stock market has been performing
                            well in recent years.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Achieving Long-term Goals -</strong> Investing
                            early can help you achieve long-term financial goals such as retirement, purchasing a home,
                            or starting a business. By starting early, you can take advantage of compound interest and
                            have a longer time horizon to ride out market volatility.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Building Financial Discipline -</strong>
                            Investing early requires discipline and a long-term outlook. This forces you to create a
                            budget and stick to it, which helps build financial discipline. This discipline carries over
                            into other areas of your life, such as saving money and making wise spending decisions.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Diversification -</strong> Investing early
                            allows you to diversify your portfolio and spread your risk. By investing in a variety of
                            assets, such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and real estate, you reduce your exposure to
                            any one asset class. In India, there are a wide variety of investment options available,
                            including mutual funds, stocks, and real estate, which allows you to build a diversified
                            portfolio.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Tax Benefits -</strong> Investing in India comes
                            with tax benefits, which can help reduce your tax liability. For example, investing in a
                            Public Provident Fund (PPF) account allows you to claim a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh
                            under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Investing in an Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)
                            mutual fund can also help you save on taxes.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, investing early in India is just as
                            important as it is anywhere else in the world. The benefits of starting early include
                            compounding interest, achieving long-term goals, building financial discipline,
                            diversification, and tax benefits. So, if you haven't started investing yet, it's time to
                            get started. Don't wait, as every day you delay means you are missing out on potential
                            gains. Start investing now and give your investments the time they need to grow and compound
                            over time.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">5 habits that helped me save a lot of money</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>  May 7, 2023 : 10:09 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is not important how much money you earn. What is more important is that how much of it do you save and even more critical is how much of that money works really hard for you!</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Your ability to do this in your life is a function of what money software you run in your brain. Over the years I have been working on my own money software or my money blueprint, because of which I have been able to life the live that I love. Today I will share some of the important components of my money thinking with you. Read on.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Spending on my passion –</strong> a few decades back, I used to spend randomly, without any specific intention. It was like my friends bought a bike, so I must buy one. Its Diwali time, so I must buy new clothes – even if I have a lot that I don’t even use. It was more like compulsive shopping either out of peer pressure or circumstantial. But once I went over all my spending for a year, and realized that not everything I buy is useful or makes me happy. That’s when I linked my major spending to my passion – which is food and travel. Now I spend very intentionally. I keep my spending low on things that are essential but are not closely linked to my passion. For example, I will always buy clothes only at a sale. Or I always buy a second hand car that is used just under a year. So, my idea is to keep expenses low on items that are delivering low value, but are essential for living decent life. But when it comes to travelling, I usually take 2 long vacations every year. One is a 25 to 30 day vacation in some foreign country and another is a 15-20 day trekking break usually in the Himalayas. By reducing my spending on things that deliver low value and continuing to spend money on things that are really important, it helps me balance out my life and does not create a feeling of being deprived of something. In fact when I spend on my passion, it keeps me charged for the rest of the year.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Buy Quality –</strong> Few decades back I used to believe in buying cheap. That was the time I was not really looking at the quality, but just the price of things. The experience of life was that things used to get useless faster and I was always shopping back again. Overtime I changed my habit from buying cheap to buying quality. Now I have stopped compromising on quality, rather I give it first priority. But I keep finding ways and means to buy quality at a lower price. For example I bought a Samsung Note 9 – 500GB phone 2 years back. At the time of buying this phone was selling at 95000 on Amazon, but I got one at just 30000. It was from a reliable source and used for just 4 months. This way I got quality at a lower price, serving my purpose. I realized that paying for quality saves money on the long run.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Consciously Reducing lifestyle expenses -</strong> The most common thing that happens is your expenses increase in proportion to your income. I have been managing money for a few thousand clients since 1999 and I have seen this happen in most cases. This was a great learning and I have converted it into a habit for myself – I have been very intentional in reducing my lifestyle expenses over the years. Not just maintaining the expenses, rather actually looking for ways to reduce them consciously. This is what I call lifestyle optimization. This has made my life simpler and I have been very contended. Another big thing that happened because of this is that my savings rate has gone up drastically.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Keeping debt low -</strong> In today’s world, it is easy to get a loan like never before. This makes people an easy prey for the finance companies selling debt. Plus we are under constant pressure to look rich. So everyone is more than eager to buy that dream house, dream car and dream vacation – all on loan. Most of us believe that the price you pay for anything you buy is in currency or rupees. Unfortunately this is half true. According to me the price is paid in terms of time, and not money. So when you take up a housing loan for instance, for most people their EMI is on an average 30% of their income. What it means is that for a 20 year tenure loan, one has to work 6.5 years for the bank – to pay your EMI. For me this is a very BIG price to pay, losing 6.5 years of my life for the bank. Hence I have managed to keep very low debt levels in my life. Typically, my debt is less than 5% of my income. This gives me the freedom to invest more money and also work less as I have a lower commitment that would trap me and make someone else rich, the bank for instance.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Spend last, Safe first  -</strong> This is probably the most talked about rule in the world of money, pay yourself first. Unfortunately most people know it, but do not follow it. I realized its importance way back in 2003 and changed my mental money math accordingly. This is probably one of the most powerful rule of money and it has worked exceedingly well for me over the years. Initially, I used to save at the end of the month and had little left to save. Once I changed this and started saving at the beginning, life has been much better since then. Now I not only save more but have more money to spend also. It is almost like magic and cannot be explained unless you experience it for yourself. This one habit will sky rocket your monthly saving in no time. Living the life you love – it’s pretty simple if you form the correct money habits. Saving is no rocket science, it’s just very basic common sense. By spending intentionally on things that add value, you can save a lot by avoiding petty low value expenses. Just by buying quality items that last longer, you can replace many cheap items. If you managed and reduce the fixed costs of your lifestyle and also focus on increasing your income overtime, your saving with increase manifold. Keeping debt levels low will keep money in your pocket leaving you with more choices in life. Just by paying myself first, I have managed to turn my life around in a matter of few years. This is the most powerful money habit you can ever develop.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">My secret to improving my finances is focusing on the long term and develop money habits that work. Habits get developed over time, but once done they keep you on track towards your financial goals. I hope you develop them and enjoy the journey towards a financially abundant life.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">How to start investing?</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>  May 7, 2023 : 10:10 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Over the last 2 decades we have interacted with a huge number of people. Almost everyone of them wanted a good life and was willing to invest. However, a majority of them were confused on how to start. In todays world, all of us are bombarded with a lots of information, most of which is either useless or overwhelming.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Plus most people never start investing seriously due to two primary reasons. First is the fear or losing money (or making an investment blunder) and second is that most people are financially illiterate (whether they admit this or not).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">However, each one of us can invest. Today, I will share with you a process that is simple and workable.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 1 – Make investing a part of your routine</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most people understand that investing is important, but it is not their first priority. It is one of the many things to do in life. Just like we eat and sleep regularly, investing has to be a part of your regular routine. Make it a habit to invest some money every month (if not weekly). Because if you do not bring even this much discipline, who else will do it for your life? No body cares…</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 2 – Start investing in whatever you understand</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is always better to start with something which is a part of your comfort zone. Rather than looking for the most fanciest investments, I suggest start taking baby steps. Start with a simple fixed deposit. What is more important at the beginning, is to get into the habit of regular investing, rather than investing in the best thing around (which is not there actually).</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 3 – Start as early as is possible</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing is a long term process. Time is much more crucial than the amount of money you invest. Most people delay investments because they do not earn enough. This is the biggest mistake. Start early, even if that means starting small. For example if you invested just Rs. 5000 per month when your are 25, and invested it till you are 50, you will have generated Rs. 67 Lakh at 10% ROI.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Now just delay that investment decision by 10 years and you will be left with just Rs. 21 lakh in the same time. Also, you will need to invest Rs. 16000 (more than 3 times the original amount), per month 10 years later if you wanted to get the same final amount. The chances of investing increased amount 10 years later are very low, because most people do not do these calculations and the expenses catch up with increasing income, faster than you can imagine.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 4 – Consult a financial advisor</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most people act penny wise pound foolish. They will go to a doctor for their health problems but will be reluctant to spend on a proper financial advisor for their financial health. The way you do one thing, you do all things. People buy a TV set for Rs. 50,000 and never bargain (some even link it to their status or prestige, what B.S.), but buy vegetables worth Rs. 200 and will haggle for saving peanuts (what a waste of talent, huh). A good financial advisor can save you from making wrong investments as well as staying invested in wrong investments for long (one worst thing than being wrong, is staying wrong).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing is more about discipline and less about money. Most people never realize this. They keep working hard, investing little and live the life hoping one fine day, things will get better. I hope you will choose a better way for yourself.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #0f0f0f;">Happy Investing!</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">Perpetual BONDs – should you invest?</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>  May 7, 2023 : 10:12 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Perpetual bonds are commonly issued by banks to the retail investors. These are the bonds that given a higher interest rate that the bank FD (in the same bank). The perpetual bonds are mostly sold to people who seek regular income and the retired people are a soft target for this product.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Since most common people are “financially illiterate” they fall prey to the bold titles showing higher interest rate. They do little research and are rarely aware of the risks involved in such investments, especially from the bad banks.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Let us first see what is a perpetual bond. A perpetual bond, also know as “consol” bond or “prep” is a fixed income instrument with no maturity date. What this means is that you invest your money in this bond and keep receiving interest perpetually. This also means, these bonds are non-redeemable. These bonds are often viewed as equity rather than debt. However the interest paid on the perpetual bond is taxable as per your existing tax bracket.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #000000;">Few risks in perpetual bonds that you need to understand –</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Default risk –</strong>Unlike FDs where the RBI gives a guarantee up to 5 lakhs (FD insurance – watch delayed video –https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaabIzwy_PM) -the perpetual bonds have no guarantees even though issued by the banks. These bonds are typically issued to shore up the capital of the banks. If the banks capital drops below certain threshold levels because of NPAs or anything, the banks are free to skip interest payment to the investors or even write-down their value (this is what YES bank did recently) In the recent case of YES bank, the perpetual bonds holders were given last priority treatment. There is a high concentration risk involved as you are investing full capital of Rs. 10L or more in single instrument (if you invested the same money in debt funds or low risk equity funds, you get the advantage of diversification).</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Repayment Risk –</strong>Perpetual bonds are often marketed as having 5 or 10 year tenor. However, the financially illiterate investors are often oblivious to the fact that the maturity of the bond is the banks right to pay the principal. The investor is rarely made aware of the fact that the bank is not bound to pay back the capital to the investors (hence the name perpetual) and it may chose not top pay back the capital and keep paying the interest. In fact the banks can even skip the interest payment and the investor cannot do much. The banks even write-down the value of the bonds as was seen in case of YES bank. This makes it a investment totally controlled by the bank and the investors are at the mercy of the bank, always.</p>                         
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Currently most banks are under stress due to the Covid-19 situation. More than 30% of the loan books of major banks are under moratorium (where the EMI payments can be halted by the borrowers). If some of these loans go into NPA, they can wipe out a lot of perpetual bonds.</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Liquidity Risk –</strong>If you have an emergency in your life or need the money for some major expense, you will have to sell your perpetual bond in the open market. However, in India the corporate bond market is very thin and bonds are often illiquid due to this low demand. You may not get a buyer when you want it badly (just like in real estate). This lack of liquidity is what forced the Franklin fund house to close its 6 debt schemes in April 2020. As against this the banks FDs are fully liquid and the debt funds too remain extremely liquid even after the Franklin fiasco last year.</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Inflation Risk –</strong>The inflation risk is highest in long tenor bonds like perpetual bonds. It is the risk where the inflation rate is very close to or higher than your bond yield. In this case you do not actually make money on your investment any longer.</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Interest Rate Risk –</strong>When inflation rises, interest rates rise too. If interest rates increase, bond prices fall. This effect is particularly harmful for long tenor bonds like perpetual bonds. A drop in bond price will hurt badly if you want to prematurely exit. You may get lower price than your investment in such a emergency exit – provided you get a buyer though.</p>
                         <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Conclusion –</strong>Higher interest rate is always a bait for the uninformed investors. Most retail investors make a mistake of assuming all debt investments as safe and fall prey to the marketing gimmicks by the banks. However, you must think clearly and study all risks before you invest your hard earned money in such perpetual bonds – especially when they are offered as very safe investments by the banks. When it comes to investing in debt, the first priority must be given to liquidity and safety and last priority to returns. A slightly higher rate of interest (especially when the same bank offers low interest on FDs) and be a BIG risk on your capital. Beware, educate and choose wisely.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold" style="color: #000;">Understanding EPF & PPF</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023 : 10:14 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">There are more than 6 crore members contributing to the Employee Provident Fund as per the most recent data on the EPFO website. These are primarily the people employed in the organized sector in our country. The Employee Provident Fund is basically a retirement benefit scheme designed by the government for the salaried employees. This is a compulsory deduction from the salary and the government understands that people may not invest for their retirement at all if it is not made mandatory.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The employee and the employer make an equal contribution of 12% of the employee’s salary every month. The employee however has an option to increase his monthly contribution voluntarily. Out of the 12% contribution by the employer, 3.67% goes to the EPF account and 8.33% to the Employees’ Pension Scheme EPS. This part does not earn any interest and cannot be withdrawn. It is paid out as pension after retirement.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The EPF contribution earns a fixed rate of interest announced by the government from time to time. Currently this is 8.50%.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The best thing about EPF is that the total amount accumulated as well as the interest earned is completely tax free when the employee withdraws this amount at retirement. However, if the amount is withdrawn before completing 5 years of employment, it is taxable.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• There are some conditions under which premature withdrawal is allowed. One way is to take a loan on the EPF amount. Withdrawal is allowed for daughters marriage or building your own house. In case the person is unemployed, he can withdraw 75% amount after 1 month and remaining 25% after 3 months.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The EPF account becomes dormant and inactive if no contributions are not made for a continuous period of 3 years. Interest is offered for inactive accounts of people who have not attended retirement age of 60, but no interest is offered for members above 60 years of age. However, the interest paid on an inactive account is taxable just like that on a regular bank FD.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The amount contributed to EPF gives you a tax benefit under Section 80C if the income tax act.</li>                                       
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Now let’s look at PPF – Public Provident Fund – this is yet another long term investment asset managed by the government of India. Any person can open a PPF account usually through a bank or a post office. It is not mandatory that you need to be employed to open this account unlike than in case of EPF.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF is a long term investment option available for investors who wish to keep their capital safe, earn a good rate of interest which is pretty stable too.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF is well suited for the low risk investor and it is backed up by the guaranteed returns by the Government of India</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Let us look at some features of the PPF account</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF investment comes with a lock in period of 15 years and one cannot withdraw the money completely before the end of 15 years. The investor can extend the investment period by another 5 years by choice.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• A minimum contribution of Rs. 500 and a maximum contribution of Rs. 1,50,000 can be made in a single financial year. It can be invested in lump sum or a maximum of 12 instalments in a year. Investing every year is mandatory to keep the account live.</li>                                                 
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• One can take loan against the investment in PPF. Loan is available from start of 3rd year till end of 6th year from opening of the account. Loan amount is maximum 25% of the amount balance in the end of first year – that is 25% of 1.50L = 37500</li>                                                 
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• After 6th year, you are allowed to make 1 withdrawal in any 1 year. The limit for withdrawal is 50% of balance at end of 4th year preceding the year in which you want to withdraw or immediate preceding year, whichever is lower.</li>                                                 
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">•If you extend your account beyond 15 years, a partial withdrawal of 60% of the balance at end of 15 years</li> 
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">•People you are ready to keep their money locked in for 15 years and do not want to take any risk will find investing in PPF a good option.


                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">•There was a time when PPF used to give a 12% interest. However, currently it gives an interest of 7.1%, with the interest rate consistently decreasing over the years.                        </ul>

                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #020202;">Conclusion –</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">  EPF is a better option than PPF as far as returns are concerned. Most people use PPF for tax saving but there are better options available which we shall see in some future post.
