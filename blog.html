                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Financial freedom is a goal that many people strive for, and for good reason. Achieving financial freedom means having the ability to live the life you want without worrying about money. It means having enough money to cover your basic needs, as well as your wants and desires, without having to rely on a job or someone else for financial support.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Here are some tips to help you achieve financial freedom:</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Create a budget and stick to it: A budget is a
                                plan for your money that helps you control your spending. Start by tracking your income
                                and expenses for a few months to get an idea of where your money is going. Then, create
                                a budget that includes your monthly expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, food,
                                transportation, and savings. Stick to your budget as much as possible, but also allow
                                for some flexibility.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Reduce your debt: Debt can be a major obstacle to
                                achieving financial freedom. Start by paying off high-interest debt, such as credit
                                cards or personal loans, as quickly as possible. You can also consider consolidating
                                your debt into a single payment with a lower interest rate.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Save for emergencies: Unexpected expenses can
                                quickly derail your finances. Make sure you have an emergency fund to cover unexpected
                                expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Aim to save at least 3-6
                                months’ worth of living expenses in your emergency fund.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Invest for the future: Investing can help you
                                grow your wealth over time. Consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks,
                                bonds, and other assets that align with your long-term financial goals.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Live below your means: Living below your means is
                                one of the most important steps to achieving financial freedom. It means spending less

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">Which is a better tax saving option ? ELSS or PPF
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">When it comes to tax saving investments in India, two
                            popular options are Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Equity-Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS)
                            mutual funds. Both PPF and ELSS investments offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the
                            Income Tax Act, 1961. However, there are some significant differences between the two that
                            investors should consider before making a decision.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">PPF is a government-backed investment scheme that offers
                            a fixed rate of interest and has a lock-in period of 15 years. The minimum annual investment
                            in PPF is Rs. 500, and the maximum is Rs. 1.5 lakh. The interest earned on PPF is tax-free,
                            and the investment qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80C. Currently PPF pays an
                            annual interest rate of 7.1%.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">On the other hand, ELSS mutual funds are equity-oriented
                            mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks. ELSS has a lock-in period of three years, and
                            the minimum investment is Rs. 500. There is no maximum limit for investment in ELSS, and
                            investors can invest as much as they want. The returns on ELSS are market-linked and not
                            fixed. Typically ELSS schemes deliver double digit returns over a investment period of 7
                            years or more.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">To compare the investment and returns data for the last
                            20 years, let's take a look at the historical performance of PPF and ELSS mutual funds.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">From 2003 to 2022, the interest rate on PPF varied from
                            8.0% to 7.1%. Over the same period, the average annual return of ELSS mutual funds was
                            around 12%. It is important to note that past performance does not guarantee future returns,
                            and investors should always consult with a financial advisor before making investment
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">As an investment firm with over 23 years of experience,
                            FINDAS can help clients invest in ELSS mutual funds. We have a team of experienced
                            professionals who have been through good and bad times in the market, and we have a proven

                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, while PPF is a safe and secure investment
                            option, ELSS mutual funds offer higher returns over the long term. Investors should consider
                            their risk tolerance, investment goals, and financial situation before choosing between the
                            two options. As an experienced investment firm, FINDAS can help clients invest in ELSS
                            mutual funds and achieve their financial objectives.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing in mutual funds is an easy and effective way
                            to grow your wealth. Mutual funds have been gaining popularity in India over the past decade
                            due to their simplicity, flexibility, and low investment requirements. In this blog post, we
                            will discuss the importance and ease of investing in mutual funds in India, the types of
                            mutual funds available, and the history and returns generated by mutual funds in India.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Importance of Investing in Mutual Funds</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Mutual funds are a great way to invest your money and
                            diversify your portfolio. They offer several benefits, including professional management,
                            diversification, liquidity, affordability, and tax benefits. Professional fund managers
                            manage mutual funds, making them ideal for investors who lack the time, knowledge, or
                            expertise to manage their own investments. Additionally, mutual funds are diversified, which
                            means they invest in a range of securities, reducing the risk of losing your entire
                            investment in one stock.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Ease of Investing in Mutual Funds</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing in mutual funds is a straightforward process.
                            You can buy mutual funds online or through a broker. Mutual funds are also affordable, with
                            investment minimums as low as INR 100. Mutual funds are also flexible, allowing you to buy
                            or sell units whenever you need to without any exit load or penalty.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Types of Mutual Funds Available</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">There are several types of mutual funds available in
                            India, including equity funds, debt funds, hybrid funds, and international funds. Equity
                            funds invest primarily in stocks, offering higher returns but also higher risk. Debt funds
                            invest in fixed-income securities like bonds and offer more stable returns. Hybrid funds
                            combine equity and debt instruments, offering a balance between returns and risk.
                            International funds invest in foreign markets and offer diversification beyond Indian
                            markets.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #000;" class="mt-3">History and Returns Generated by Mutual
                            Funds in India</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Mutual funds have a long history in India, with the
                            first mutual fund launched in 1964. Since then, mutual funds have grown significantly, with
                            assets under management (AUM) increasing from INR 1.97 lakh crore in 1998 to INR 40 lakh
                            crore in 2022. Mutual funds have generated impressive returns, with some equity funds
                            providing returns of up to 12-20% over the past decade.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, investing in mutual funds is an important
                            and easy way to grow your wealth. With several types of mutual funds available and
                            impressive returns generated by mutual funds in India, investors can choose the right mutual
                            funds to meet their investment objectives and financial goals. However, before investing in
                            mutual funds, it is important to understand your risk tolerance and investment horizon and
                            consult a financial advisor to make informed investment decisions.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">Benefits of investing early in life</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing early in life is just as important in India as
                            it is anywhere else in the world. The benefits of investing early can be significant and can
                            help you achieve your financial goals.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Compounding Interest -</strong> Compounding
                            interest is just as powerful in India as it is anywhere else. The longer you let your
                            investments grow, the more substantial your returns will be. This is particularly important
                            in India, where the economy is growing rapidly, and the stock market has been performing
                            well in recent years.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Achieving Long-term Goals -</strong> Investing
                            early can help you achieve long-term financial goals such as retirement, purchasing a home,
                            or starting a business. By starting early, you can take advantage of compound interest and
                            have a longer time horizon to ride out market volatility.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Building Financial Discipline -</strong>
                            Investing early requires discipline and a long-term outlook. This forces you to create a
                            budget and stick to it, which helps build financial discipline. This discipline carries over
                            into other areas of your life, such as saving money and making wise spending decisions.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Diversification -</strong> Investing early
                            allows you to diversify your portfolio and spread your risk. By investing in a variety of
                            assets, such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and real estate, you reduce your exposure to
                            any one asset class. In India, there are a wide variety of investment options available,
                            including mutual funds, stocks, and real estate, which allows you to build a diversified
                            portfolio.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Tax Benefits -</strong> Investing in India comes
                            with tax benefits, which can help reduce your tax liability. For example, investing in a
                            Public Provident Fund (PPF) account allows you to claim a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh
                            under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Investing in an Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)
                            mutual fund can also help you save on taxes.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In conclusion, investing early in India is just as
                            important as it is anywhere else in the world. The benefits of starting early include
                            compounding interest, achieving long-term goals, building financial discipline,
                            diversification, and tax benefits. So, if you haven't started investing yet, it's time to
                            get started. Don't wait, as every day you delay means you are missing out on potential
                            gains. Start investing now and give your investments the time they need to grow and compound
                            over time.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">5 habits that helped me save a lot of money</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023 : 10:09 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is not important how much money you earn. What is
                            more important is that how much of it do you save and even more critical is how much of that
                            money works really hard for you!</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Your ability to do this in your life is a function of
                            what money software you run in your brain. Over the years I have been working on my own
                            money software or my money blueprint, because of which I have been able to life the live
                            that I love. Today I will share some of the important components of my money thinking with
                            you. Read on.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Spending on my passion –</strong> a few decades
                            back, I used to spend randomly, without any specific intention. It was like my friends
                            bought a bike, so I must buy one. Its Diwali time, so I must buy new clothes – even if I
                            have a lot that I don’t even use. It was more like compulsive shopping either out of peer
                            pressure or circumstantial. But once I went over all my spending for a year, and realized
                            that not everything I buy is useful or makes me happy. That’s when I linked my major
                            spending to my passion – which is food and travel. Now I spend very intentionally. I keep my
                            spending low on things that are essential but are not closely linked to my passion. For
                            example, I will always buy clothes only at a sale. Or I always buy a second hand car that is
                            used just under a year. So, my idea is to keep expenses low on items that are delivering low
                            value, but are essential for living decent life. But when it comes to travelling, I usually
                            take 2 long vacations every year. One is a 25 to 30 day vacation in some foreign country and
                            another is a 15-20 day trekking break usually in the Himalayas. By reducing my spending on
                            things that deliver low value and continuing to spend money on things that are really
                            important, it helps me balance out my life and does not create a feeling of being deprived
                            of something. In fact when I spend on my passion, it keeps me charged for the rest of the
                            year.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Buy Quality –</strong> Few decades back I used
                            to believe in buying cheap. That was the time I was not really looking at the quality, but
                            just the price of things. The experience of life was that things used to get useless faster
                            and I was always shopping back again. Overtime I changed my habit from buying cheap to
                            buying quality. Now I have stopped compromising on quality, rather I give it first priority.
                            But I keep finding ways and means to buy quality at a lower price. For example I bought a
                            Samsung Note 9 – 500GB phone 2 years back. At the time of buying this phone was selling at
                            95000 on Amazon, but I got one at just 30000. It was from a reliable source and used for
                            just 4 months. This way I got quality at a lower price, serving my purpose. I realized that
                            paying for quality saves money on the long run.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Consciously Reducing lifestyle expenses
                                -</strong> The most common thing that happens is your expenses increase in proportion to
                            your income. I have been managing money for a few thousand clients since 1999 and I have
                            seen this happen in most cases. This was a great learning and I have converted it into a
                            habit for myself – I have been very intentional in reducing my lifestyle expenses over the
                            years. Not just maintaining the expenses, rather actually looking for ways to reduce them
                            consciously. This is what I call lifestyle optimization. This has made my life simpler and I
                            have been very contended. Another big thing that happened because of this is that my savings
                            rate has gone up drastically.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Keeping debt low -</strong> In today’s world, it
                            is easy to get a loan like never before. This makes people an easy prey for the finance
                            companies selling debt. Plus we are under constant pressure to look rich. So everyone is
                            more than eager to buy that dream house, dream car and dream vacation – all on loan. Most of
                            us believe that the price you pay for anything you buy is in currency or rupees.
                            Unfortunately this is half true. According to me the price is paid in terms of time, and not
                            money. So when you take up a housing loan for instance, for most people their EMI is on an
                            average 30% of their income. What it means is that for a 20 year tenure loan, one has to
                            work 6.5 years for the bank – to pay your EMI. For me this is a very BIG price to pay,
                            losing 6.5 years of my life for the bank. Hence I have managed to keep very low debt levels
                            in my life. Typically, my debt is less than 5% of my income. This gives me the freedom to
                            invest more money and also work less as I have a lower commitment that would trap me and
                            make someone else rich, the bank for instance.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Spend last, Safe first -</strong> This is
                            probably the most talked about rule in the world of money, pay yourself first. Unfortunately
                            most people know it, but do not follow it. I realized its importance way back in 2003 and
                            changed my mental money math accordingly. This is probably one of the most powerful rule of
                            money and it has worked exceedingly well for me over the years. Initially, I used to save at
                            the end of the month and had little left to save. Once I changed this and started saving at
                            the beginning, life has been much better since then. Now I not only save more but have more
                            money to spend also. It is almost like magic and cannot be explained unless you experience
                            it for yourself. This one habit will sky rocket your monthly saving in no time. Living the
                            life you love – it’s pretty simple if you form the correct money habits. Saving is no rocket
                            science, it’s just very basic common sense. By spending intentionally on things that add
                            value, you can save a lot by avoiding petty low value expenses. Just by buying quality items
                            that last longer, you can replace many cheap items. If you managed and reduce the fixed
                            costs of your lifestyle and also focus on increasing your income overtime, your saving with
                            increase manifold. Keeping debt levels low will keep money in your pocket leaving you with
                            more choices in life. Just by paying myself first, I have managed to turn my life around in
                            a matter of few years. This is the most powerful money habit you can ever develop.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">My secret to improving my finances is focusing on the
                            long term and develop money habits that work. Habits get developed over time, but once done
                            they keep you on track towards your financial goals. I hope you develop them and enjoy the
                            journey towards a financially abundant life.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3" style="color: #000;">How to start investing?</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023 : 10:10 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Over the last 2 decades we have interacted with a huge
                            number of people. Almost everyone of them wanted a good life and was willing to invest.
                            However, a majority of them were confused on how to start. In todays world, all of us are
                            bombarded with a lots of information, most of which is either useless or overwhelming.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Plus most people never start investing seriously due to
                            two primary reasons. First is the fear or losing money (or making an investment blunder) and
                            second is that most people are financially illiterate (whether they admit this or not).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">However, each one of us can invest. Today, I will share
                            with you a process that is simple and workable.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 1 – Make investing a part of your
                            routine</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most people understand that investing is important, but
                            it is not their first priority. It is one of the many things to do in life. Just like we eat
                            and sleep regularly, investing has to be a part of your regular routine. Make it a habit to
                            invest some money every month (if not weekly). Because if you do not bring even this much
                            discipline, who else will do it for your life? No body cares…</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 2 – Start investing in whatever you
                            understand</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is always better to start with something which is a
                            part of your comfort zone. Rather than looking for the most fanciest investments, I suggest
                            start taking baby steps. Start with a simple fixed deposit. What is more important at the
                            beginning, is to get into the habit of regular investing, rather than investing in the best
                            thing around (which is not there actually).</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 3 – Start as early as is possible
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing is a long term process. Time is much more
                            crucial than the amount of money you invest. Most people delay investments because they do
                            not earn enough. This is the biggest mistake. Start early, even if that means starting
                            small. For example if you invested just Rs. 5000 per month when your are 25, and invested it
                            till you are 50, you will have generated Rs. 67 Lakh at 10% ROI.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Now just delay that investment decision by 10 years and
                            you will be left with just Rs. 21 lakh in the same time. Also, you will need to invest Rs.
                            16000 (more than 3 times the original amount), per month 10 years later if you wanted to get
                            the same final amount. The chances of investing increased amount 10 years later are very
                            low, because most people do not do these calculations and the expenses catch up with
                            increasing income, faster than you can imagine.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #000;" class="mt-3">Step 4 – Consult a financial advisor</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most people act penny wise pound foolish. They will go
                            to a doctor for their health problems but will be reluctant to spend on a proper financial
                            advisor for their financial health. The way you do one thing, you do all things. People buy
                            a TV set for Rs. 50,000 and never bargain (some even link it to their status or prestige,
                            what B.S.), but buy vegetables worth Rs. 200 and will haggle for saving peanuts (what a
                            waste of talent, huh). A good financial advisor can save you from making wrong investments
                            as well as staying invested in wrong investments for long (one worst thing than being wrong,
                            is staying wrong).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Investing is more about discipline and less about money.
                            Most people never realize this. They keep working hard, investing little and live the life
                            hoping one fine day, things will get better. I hope you will choose a better way for
                            yourself.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #0f0f0f;">Happy Investing!</p>

                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023 : 10:12 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Perpetual bonds are commonly issued by banks to the
                            retail investors. These are the bonds that given a higher interest rate that the bank FD (in
                            the same bank). The perpetual bonds are mostly sold to people who seek regular income and
                            the retired people are a soft target for this product.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Since most common people are “financially illiterate”
                            they fall prey to the bold titles showing higher interest rate. They do little research and
                            are rarely aware of the risks involved in such investments, especially from the bad banks.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Let us first see what is a perpetual bond. A perpetual
                            bond, also know as “consol” bond or “prep” is a fixed income instrument with no maturity
                            date. What this means is that you invest your money in this bond and keep receiving interest
                            perpetually. This also means, these bonds are non-redeemable. These bonds are often viewed
                            as equity rather than debt. However the interest paid on the perpetual bond is taxable as
                            per your existing tax bracket.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #000000;">Few risks in perpetual bonds that you need to understand
                            –</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Default risk –</strong>Unlike FDs where the RBI
                            gives a guarantee up to 5 lakhs (FD insurance – watch delayed video
                            –https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaabIzwy_PM) -the perpetual bonds have no guarantees even
                            though issued by the banks. These bonds are typically issued to shore up the capital of the
                            banks. If the banks capital drops below certain threshold levels because of NPAs or
                            anything, the banks are free to skip interest payment to the investors or even write-down
                            their value (this is what YES bank did recently) In the recent case of YES bank, the
                            perpetual bonds holders were given last priority treatment. There is a high concentration
                            risk involved as you are investing full capital of Rs. 10L or more in single instrument (if
                            you invested the same money in debt funds or low risk equity funds, you get the advantage of
                            diversification).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Repayment Risk –</strong>Perpetual bonds are
                            often marketed as having 5 or 10 year tenor. However, the financially illiterate investors
                            are often oblivious to the fact that the maturity of the bond is the banks right to pay the
                            principal. The investor is rarely made aware of the fact that the bank is not bound to pay
                            back the capital to the investors (hence the name perpetual) and it may chose not top pay
                            back the capital and keep paying the interest. In fact the banks can even skip the interest
                            payment and the investor cannot do much. The banks even write-down the value of the bonds as
                            was seen in case of YES bank. This makes it a investment totally controlled by the bank and
                            the investors are at the mercy of the bank, always.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Currently most banks are under stress due to the
                            Covid-19 situation. More than 30% of the loan books of major banks are under moratorium
                            (where the EMI payments can be halted by the borrowers). If some of these loans go into NPA,
                            they can wipe out a lot of perpetual bonds.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Liquidity Risk –</strong>If you have an
                            emergency in your life or need the money for some major expense, you will have to sell your
                            perpetual bond in the open market. However, in India the corporate bond market is very thin
                            and bonds are often illiquid due to this low demand. You may not get a buyer when you want
                            it badly (just like in real estate). This lack of liquidity is what forced the Franklin fund
                            house to close its 6 debt schemes in April 2020. As against this the banks FDs are fully
                            liquid and the debt funds too remain extremely liquid even after the Franklin fiasco last
                            year.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Inflation Risk –</strong>The inflation risk is
                            highest in long tenor bonds like perpetual bonds. It is the risk where the inflation rate is
                            very close to or higher than your bond yield. In this case you do not actually make money on
                            your investment any longer.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Interest Rate Risk –</strong>When inflation
                            rises, interest rates rise too. If interest rates increase, bond prices fall. This effect is
                            particularly harmful for long tenor bonds like perpetual bonds. A drop in bond price will
                            hurt badly if you want to prematurely exit. You may get lower price than your investment in
                            such a emergency exit – provided you get a buyer though.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Conclusion –</strong>Higher interest rate is
                            always a bait for the uninformed investors. Most retail investors make a mistake of assuming
                            all debt investments as safe and fall prey to the marketing gimmicks by the banks. However,
                            you must think clearly and study all risks before you invest your hard earned money in such
                            perpetual bonds – especially when they are offered as very safe investments by the banks.
                            When it comes to investing in debt, the first priority must be given to liquidity and safety
                            and last priority to returns. A slightly higher rate of interest (especially when the same
                            bank offers low interest on FDs) and be a BIG risk on your capital. Beware, educate and
                            choose wisely.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold" style="color: #000;">Understanding EPF & PPF</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted mt-3"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023 : 10:14 PM</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">There are more than 6 crore members contributing to the
                            Employee Provident Fund as per the most recent data on the EPFO website. These are primarily
                            the people employed in the organized sector in our country. The Employee Provident Fund is
                            basically a retirement benefit scheme designed by the government for the salaried employees.
                            This is a compulsory deduction from the salary and the government understands that people
                            may not invest for their retirement at all if it is not made mandatory.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The employee and the employer make an equal
                                contribution of 12% of the employee’s salary every month. The employee however has an
                                option to increase his monthly contribution voluntarily. Out of the 12% contribution by
                                the employer, 3.67% goes to the EPF account and 8.33% to the Employees’ Pension Scheme
                                EPS. This part does not earn any interest and cannot be withdrawn. It is paid out as
                                pension after retirement.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The EPF contribution earns a fixed rate of
                                interest announced by the government from time to time. Currently this is 8.50%.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The best thing about EPF is that the total amount
                                accumulated as well as the interest earned is completely tax free when the employee
                                withdraws this amount at retirement. However, if the amount is withdrawn before
                                completing 5 years of employment, it is taxable.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• There are some conditions under which premature
                                withdrawal is allowed. One way is to take a loan on the EPF amount. Withdrawal is
                                allowed for daughters marriage or building your own house. In case the person is
                                unemployed, he can withdraw 75% amount after 1 month and remaining 25% after 3 months.
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The EPF account becomes dormant and inactive if
                                no contributions are not made for a continuous period of 3 years. Interest is offered
                                for inactive accounts of people who have not attended retirement age of 60, but no
                                interest is offered for members above 60 years of age. However, the interest paid on an
                                inactive account is taxable just like that on a regular bank FD.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The amount contributed to EPF gives you a tax
                                benefit under Section 80C if the income tax act.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Now let’s look at PPF – Public Provident Fund – this is
                            yet another long term investment asset managed by the government of India. Any person can
                            open a PPF account usually through a bank or a post office. It is not mandatory that you
                            need to be employed to open this account unlike than in case of EPF.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF is a long term investment option available
                                for investors who wish to keep their capital safe, earn a good rate of interest which is
                                pretty stable too.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF is well suited for the low risk investor and
                                it is backed up by the guaranteed returns by the Government of India</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• Let us look at some features of the PPF account
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• PPF investment comes with a lock in period of 15
                                years and one cannot withdraw the money completely before the end of 15 years. The
                                investor can extend the investment period by another 5 years by choice.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• A minimum contribution of Rs. 500 and a maximum
                                contribution of Rs. 1,50,000 can be made in a single financial year. It can be invested
                                in lump sum or a maximum of 12 instalments in a year. Investing every year is mandatory
                                to keep the account live.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• One can take loan against the investment in PPF.
                                Loan is available from start of 3rd year till end of 6th year from opening of the
                                account. Loan amount is maximum 25% of the amount balance in the end of first year –
                                that is 25% of 1.50L = 37500</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• After 6th year, you are allowed to make 1
                                withdrawal in any 1 year. The limit for withdrawal is 50% of balance at end of 4th year
                                preceding the year in which you want to withdraw or immediate preceding year, whichever
                                is lower.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">•If you extend your account beyond 15 years, a
                                partial withdrawal of 60% of the balance at end of 15 years</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• People you are ready to keep their money locked
                                in
                                for 15 years and do not want to take any risk will find investing in PPF a good option.
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">•There was a time when PPF used to give a 12%
                                interest. However, currently it gives an interest of 7.1%, with the interest rate
                                consistently decreasing over the years. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #020202;">Conclusion –</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"> EPF is a better option than PPF as far as returns are
                            concerned. Most people use PPF for tax saving but there are better options available which
                            we shall see in some future post. </p>

                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>01. SAVING WILL NOT MAKE YOU WEALTHY
                                    -</strong> Unless you are saving a few lakh rupees every month you will not become
                                wealthy by just saving some money. You need to use that money in a better way to convert
                                it into wealth. Having cash is good as a contingency fund – something happens to your
                                regular income – like you lose your job or something, it is good to have between 6 to 12
                                months of savings in cash – this will help your survive the bad patch. Cash will also
                                help you encash an opportunity. Having cash will help you grab a opportunity like a
                                business or help you negotiate something in your favor.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>02. BEING WEALTHY IS NOT ABOUT SHOWING OFF
                                    -</strong> If you have a lot of wealth, it does not mean you will have to own a big
                                house or a luxury car. Being wealthy is about having assets. Assets are things like
                                business or investment that bring additional cash flow or interest to your income or
                                which appreciate in value beating the inflation. Showing off can lead you to acquiring
                                things like cars that actually drain your pockets. Owning a big house just to look rich
                                can cause you to pay a major portion of your income into EMI payments for decades. One
                                of the classical definitions of being wealthy is how many days can you survive if your
                                income stopped tomorrow. The longer you can live, the wealthier you are.
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>03. UNDERSTAND TAX -</strong> Many people
                                worry too much about taxes. There is more fear rather than understanding about taxes.
                                Instead of making taxes work in their favor people are busy finding ways to avoid them.
                                To master money, you have to use taxes for your benefit and not against you. Find out
                                how you get tax breaks so that you can save money, invest it and save even more taxes.
                                Learn to use taxes so that you keep more money in your pocket legally.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>04.LEARN HOW TO USE OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY
                                    -</strong> Many people are so terrified of using loans, that they use their own
                                money for everything they do including business. Loans maybe good or bad based on how
                                you use them. For example, if you had a housing loan and wanted to get an education loan
                                for your kid, it will make more sense to use a top up loan on the existing housing loan
                                as it will be at least 1.5% cheaper. Or most people do not know that by investing
                                properly you can actually reduce the interest on your housing loan by 50% or more.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>05.EARN MORE AND SPEND LESS -</strong> We
                                need to focus on both at the same time. Make yourself an asset in your job or your
                                business, upgrade your abilities continuously and strive to become a better person every
                                day. This way you increase your chances of earning more. As your income goes up, keep
                                your expenses low. Most people find this difficult to do and end up increasing their
                                expenses in proportion to their incomes.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>06.KEEP TRACK OF YOUR CASH FLOW -</strong>
                                Most people are good at making money but struggle with keeping the money in their
                                pockets. The reason for this is not knowing their cash flow. Most people only have a
                                faint idea about how much are their expenses. Less than 10% of people actually record
                                their expenses on a regular basis. Keeping close track of your income and expenses helps
                                you in avoiding unwanted expenses and provides with the additional money for investing.
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>07.PLAN YOUR RETIREMENT EARLY -</strong>
                                Most people start thinking about planning their retirement only after age 35 and
                                majority of them keep postponing any serious action way beyond 45. Most people below the
                                age 30 do not have a slightest idea of how much money it takes to live for 20-25 years
                                without active income. Hence the best way is to plan your retirement as early as you
                                can. Because an early start gives you the highest benefit of compounding.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>08.KEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE -</strong> You must
                                safe guard your hard earned money before you can actually grow it. Most people are in a
                                hurry to generate return on investment and forget to put a fence around their money.
                                Look at things that will take BIG money out of your pocket. Things like a major health
                                issue, accident or theft. You need to protect yourself against such incidents. Another
                                way is to diversify your investments into multiple assets. This will help you reduce
                                your losses over multiple market cycles.

                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>09.TREAT YOUR MONEY LIKE YOUR EMPLOYEE
                                    -</strong> Most people are very serious before they earn money, but lazy after they
                                have it in their bank. The best way to treat your money is by making it work. Money
                                doesn’t like to relax. You need to give it work, else it will slowly go away to a better
                                master. Make sure you engage every single rupee in some kind of investment vehicle at
                                all times. This way your money will work hard for you.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>10.SET SOME MONEY RULES THAT WORK FOR YOU
                                    -</strong> The nature of money is like water. It keep flowing unless you create
                                rules or dams to contain it. You need to set basic rules like how much of your income
                                are you going to spend on cost of living and how much of it are you going to save. Out
                                of the money you save, you need to set rules as to how much of your savings are for
                                contingency, how much for long term important goals and how much for fun and enjoyment.
                                Setting up rules will create a balance in your life.

                        <h3 class="fw-bold" style="color: #000;">Take charge of your financial life</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Here are the reasons why you need to take charge of your
                            financial life as early as possible. We have been working in this area of financial
                            planning, since the year 1999 with our experience of so many years, we have certain
                            observations about people on how they deal with their financial lives before they come to
                            us. people are very passive, or casual about their financial management, after they have
                            earned the money that they wanted to earn.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The second observation is most of our education that we
                            take, irrespective of whether you are an engineer or a doctor or a business owner, gives us
                            only one skill. The education is designed in such a way that it gives us a common skill.
                            That is how to make money, or how to earn money. Unfortunately, our educational system fails
                            to deal with an abundance of the money cycle, and that is what to do with the money. Once
                            you have earned it such that you are able to live the life that you love.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The third observation is that most people deal with
                            their financial management on their own, they follow what we call the to eat yourself method
                            to deal with their finances, just like when you have a health issue you go to a doctor, or
                            if you have a legal issue you go to an advocate, you need to go to a financial expert, when
                            you need to deal with financial management in your life. Unfortunately, in India, just about
                            3 to 4% of the people, consult a financial expert in view of these three observations.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">We are going to now discuss why you need to take charge
                            of your financial life as early as possible.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The first reason why you need to take charge of
                                your financial life as early as possible, is that the days when the government used to
                                take care of your old age deeds are gone. There was a time in this country. When once
                                you took up a job, the government would take care of everything. Till you are alive, but
                                this is no longer to. It is only you who has to provide for all your financial needs.
                                Plus, in this age of nuclear families, there is now no guarantee that your children
                                would be around to support you in your old age. Unfortunately, the truth of life is जबतक
                                आपके पास पैसे है, लोग पूछेंगे आप कैसे है!! So you need to have money on your side.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The second reason why you need to take charge of
                                your financial life is that this market of financial products is full of sellers.
                                Everyone is busy selling something to you without any consideration to what you actually
                                need, or what you actually want these sailors come in every from right from the young
                                boys and girls that try to sell you the credit card inside the malls while shopping to
                                the cashiers in the bank, who tried to fool you into buying mutual funds, and our old
                                friend the insurance agent who is always around the corner and carrying the best policy
                                in the world, which is closing soon, so he is in a hurry to sell you that policy, the
                                sellers are often our close acquaintances and avoiding them is a task in itself. It is,
                                however, in your favour to identify the difference between a seller, and a counselor,
                                the only agenda that a seller has is to sell his product to you. It doesn’t really
                                bother. Whether you need it or you don’t need it. However, the agenda of a good
                                counselor is first to create a tailor made solution for you, that works out for you, or
                                a period of time. And also, it is his duty to view the freedom to choose which is the
                                best choice for you.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">• The reason number three is that, because of the
                                improvement in medical sciences, all of us will most probably live longer than we
                                imagined. There is a certain pattern that we commonly see in the lives of majority of
                                the people in the initial years, when people are young, and just begin to earn, they
                                also take up loans, and end up paying EMI this EMI form a major part of their monthly
                                outflow this early stage is what we call the EMI and the liquidity crisis, as one
                                approaches the middle age, the thoughts about promotions, or career progression, start
                                crowding their minds, the people in this stage, normally would spend more time at their
                                jobs or take up part time education programs, in order to increase their market value.
                                This stage is usually followed by an urge of freedom and entrepreneurship.
                                Unfortunately, the path to successful entrepreneurship is filled with challenges that
                                one may not be mentally as well as financially, prepared to face.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">That is why the failure rate of small businesses is very
                            high, and at times, scary. This is then followed by the last and final stage of one’s
                            career. This is the time when people start wondering whether the money they have made so
                            far, will last them for a lifetime. Maybe the money will last a lifetime. You don’t know for
                            sure. Unless you have taken some time off. In the early years of your life, and made it a
                            point to work on this very important area of your life, my observation is most people are so
                            busy earning the money that they are earning, they hardly have any time left. Look, actively
                            at their financial management, although most of us realize that active financial management
                            is an important area. It is never urgent for most of us, it is just that one thing to be
                            done, sometime in life, however, let me tell you one thing very clearly at this point of
                            time living with the regret of decisions not made on time is the worst situation, you can
                            hope for, to get yourself in life, so it is time to stop and think, are you consuming most
                            of your energy in, earning the money that you earn, who is managing your financial life.
                            Does he or she have the required expertise, and the experiential knowledge to manage your
                            money, who will know your financial goals.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Do you have a strategy or a plan on how you’re going to
                            reach these goals. It is time that you give a hard thought to the fact that what is your
                            confidence level that you will live an abundant life and the life that you love. I hope that
                            you realize that taking charge of your financial life is not something to be postponed. It
                            is a very serious thing, so do it now before it’s too late. If you need any assistance in

                        <p class="text-muted"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Here we will see five simple ways to utilize your extra
                            cash flow, effectively.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Sometimes we may receive extra cash flow in form of an
                            increment or a bonus, if you are in a job or in form of extra income, if you are in a
                            business, most of the times when you anticipate such an excess cash flow coming in, you
                            already have a plan of how you’re going to use this money, more often than not, this plan is
                            about how you are going to spend this money, very few people think about investing this
                            money, less than 5% people actually take action to align this extra cash flow towards their
                            long term goal. Here are a few tips on how you can use this extra money wisely.</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>1. Create your emergency corpus -
                                </strong>Life has its own emergencies in store for all of us, many such situations need
                                a lot of money to deal with. Use this extra income to create your emergency fund. This
                                will help you in two ways. First, when such emergency comes, you will be confident to
                                deal with it, since you have money on your side. Second, it will save you from asking
                                for money from friends and relatives or taking unnecessary loans.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>2. Invest this extra money - </strong>Money
                                that you might have received for your children’s education. If you have already
                                identified the children’s education goals, then it is better to give priority to such
                                extra cash flow and follow a structure. If you haven’t already quantified your goals. It
                                is time you got in touch with finance consulting. If you need any assistance in planning
                                out and taking control of your financial life contact us.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>3. Invest extra money for your retirement
                                    savings - </strong>Most people think of their retirement eight or 10 years before
                                they actually retire. This could be very late. Think about retirement and effectively
                                plan for it. Hence, make it a point that you start planning for your retirement, as
                                early as possible, so that you have enough time to plan for it very well. Use any such
                                extra cash flow for your investments earmarked for your retirement. Never let any such
                                extra cash flow run out of your pocket as money for enjoyment, it is always better to
                                utilize this money judiciously and investigate for your long term goals.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>4. To pay off any higher interest rates -
                                </strong>Things like credit card debt or personal loan, which are charged, very high
                                interest rate must be on your priority to finish them off. So make sure that you pay off
                                all set higher dates, whenever you get an extra cash flow. But Don’t be in a hurry to
                                finish off that housing loan, unless you are charged the interest in excess of 12%. If
                                you want to know how you can actually reduce the interest of a housing loan do get in
                                touch with us. If you have just begun your housing, a few months back, we can help you
                                to reduce that housing loan to a. interest rate of just 2%, or even less than that.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>5. To buy some special insurance -
                                </strong>There are some insurances like the hardened cancer policy, or the critical
                                insurance policy that one men need when the time arises, so use this extra money to get
                                yourself covered under such special insurance policies, because they are going to be
                                very useful. If the need comes and will save you a lot of hard earned money. In the end,
                                I would like you to note that always use any such extra cash flow to invest for the long
                                term. Instead of spending it on things that give you temporary happiness, like buying
                                things that you don’t actually need, but you want to have them almost every time it is
                                delayed gratification, that helps you in creating a financially stable life.</li>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold" style="color: #000;">Most middle class families struggle</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> April 25, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most middle class families struggle to make the ends
                            meet. This is true primarily as they are unable to manage their cash flow efficiently. Most
                            have limited incomes and higher expenses. Consequently they are stressed out and may
                            actually be leading a below par life.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In order to have better control of their finances, it is
                            recommended they avoid following mistakes consciously!</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>1. Emotional buying and not bargaining
                                    enough - </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Many times people feel it below their dignity to
                                bargain. This is true especially in today’s world where mall culture is around. However,
                                the same people could many times be seen bargain hunting on online eCommerce sites like
                                Amazon etc.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is recommended to make bargaining a good habit
                                as there is no loss whatsoever. Little savings from small bargains go a long way in
                                saving money.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Emotional buying is one thing which everyone must
                                avoid. It not only creates financial pressure, but also creates a feeling of guilt, once
                                the craving for buying subsides. This is not a good emotional state to be in.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Better practice asking yourself “do I want this or
                                do I really need this” before making any buying decision. And postpone all “wants” as
                                long as you can. Most “good to have things” in life are responsible for financial
                                stress.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>2. Doing major expenses before time -
                                </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Many middle class families end up making major
                                purchases like house or car much before they can really afford them. Most of the times
                                this is done under social pressure to “look good”.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Major spending early in life puts the family in a
                                financially downward spiral as expenses increase and there is no money to invest.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Bigger expenses, typically more than your annual
                                income must be avoided unless they are properly planned and provided for with enough
                                back up.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>3. Not having enough insurance - </strong>
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">When it comes to buying adequate insurance, most
                                middle class families act penny wise pound foolish. They think insurance premium is
                                un-affordable or an unnecessary expense. However, this attitude makes them vulnerable to
                                major financial emergencies like a major medical treatment or untimely death of an
                                earning member in the family. One such incident completely shatters the family
                                financially.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Hence it is recommended to acquire adequate
                                insurance after understanding what risks need to be covered. This will help equip the
                                family to deal with any unforeseen events and financial emergencies.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>4. Not developing multiple sources of
                                    income - </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most middle class people are stuck with a single
                                source of income. Even if there are more than one earning members in the family, more
                                often then not, their cumulative income is just enough to make the ends meet.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Due to this problem of “not enough money” they end
                                up creating debt or borrowings, leading to compulsory EMI payments.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is recommended to be on look out for
                                opportunities of making some extra buck. A part time business or something where their
                                existing skills can be monetized must be considered to ease the financial demand.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>5. Wrong choice of assets - </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Most middle class families who struggle financially
                                do so due to lack of financial education. They may be word literate, but financial
                                literacy is a rare commodity. Due to this, security is often the most important thing
                                when it comes to money.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Since they operate primarily from the fear of
                                losing money, they end up parking their money in wrong assets. For most people their
                                money is either in the bank or in low return assets like FDs or PPF. They may also be
                                very inefficient in their tax saving investments, with most people using life insurance
                                and PPF.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is recommended to take professional help when it
                                comes to investing and asset selection, as one may not be equipped to deal with these
                                matters on their own.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>6. Lack of long term financial planning -
                                </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Unfortunately most middle class families fail to
                                plan their financial lives. They think seeking professional help for their health is
                                good, but for their wealth it is un-affordable or not important. In this aspect also,
                                the “penny wise pound foolish” attitude can be seen commonly.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is only through professional financial planning
                                that one can really experience all that life has to offer. Financial planning helps you
                                create a meaningful balance in life and achieve your financial goals and dreams.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">If you really care for your family and want them to
                                have an abundant life, its time you visited Findas office. Here we create actionable
                                financial plans for you to have an access to the life that you love.</li>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold" style="color: #000;">History of Mutual Funds in India</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i> May 7, 2023</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Mutual funds have become one of the most popular
                            investment vehicles in India in recent years. They offer an opportunity for retail investors
                            to pool their money together and invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and
                            other securities. In this article, we will take a brief look at the history of mutual funds
                            in India, how they have evolved over the years, and their current status in the Indian
                            market.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The concept of mutual funds first originated in the
                            Netherlands in the 18th century, when a group of investors formed a trust to invest in
                            stocks and shares. The concept then spread to other countries, including the United States,
                            where the first modern mutual fund was established in 1924. However, it wasn't until the
                            mid-1960s that mutual funds were introduced in India.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The first mutual fund in India was set up by the Unit
                            Trust of India (UTI) in 1963. The government of India set up UTI with the aim of mobilizing
                            savings from small investors and channeling them into the capital market. The first scheme
                            launched by UTI was the Unit Scheme 1964, which offered investors the opportunity to invest
                            in a diversified portfolio of stocks.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In the early years, UTI was the only player in the
                            mutual fund market in India. However, in the late 1980s, the government of India opened up
                            the mutual fund industry to private sector players. This led to the entry of several private
                            sector mutual funds, including the likes of HDFC, ICICI Prudential, and the erstwhile
                            Reliance (now Nippon India). The introduction of private sector players led to increased
                            competition and innovation in the mutual fund industry. Mutual funds started to offer a
                            wider range of investment options, including equity funds, debt funds, and hybrid funds.
                            They also introduced new investment strategies, such as index funds and exchange-traded
                            funds (ETFs).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Indian economy
                            saw a period of rapid growth, which led to a surge in the mutual fund industry. The number
                            of mutual funds and the assets under management (AUM) grew rapidly during this period.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the
                            regulator for the securities market in India, took several steps to improve the regulation
                            of the mutual fund industry. SEBI introduced several measures to protect the interests of
                            investors, including stricter disclosure norms, enhanced transparency, and the requirement
                            for mutual funds to disclose their portfolio holdings on a regular basis.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">In recent years, the mutual fund industry in India has
                            continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in the past. As of March 2023, the total AUM
                            of the mutual fund industry in India was Rs 39.42 lakh crore ($482 billion), up from Rs
                            37.56 lakh crore ($459 billion) in March 2022.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The AUM of the Indian MF Industry has grown from ₹ 7.01
                            trillion as on March 31, 2013 to ₹39.42 trillion as on March 31, 2023 more than 5 fold
                            increase in a span of 10 years.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The Indian mutual fund industry has also seen some
                            interesting trends in recent years. One trend is the growing popularity of Systematic
                            Investment Plan, the SIP. As on 31 Mar 23, all Indian investors put together have 6.36 crore
                            SIP accounts. Rs. 14276 crores were collected through SIP in March 2023 alone.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">As more and more Indians prefer to invest their money
                            through mutual funds, the SIP collection grew from Rs. 43921 crores in FY 2016-17 to Rs.
                            1,55,972 crores in FY 2022-23. This is a growth of 23.52% CAGR.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The mutual fund industry in India has come a long way
                            since the introduction of the first scheme by UTI in 1964. Today, it is a well-regulated and
                            thriving industry.</p>

                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The RBI's decision to stop the use of Rs. 2000
                                notes has a number of positive implications. First, it will make it more difficult for
                                criminals to use cash for illegal activities. Second, it will help to reduce the amount
                                of counterfeit currency in circulation. Third, it will make it easier for the government
                                to track and monitor cash transactions. Fourth, it will help to promote digital
                                payments, which are more efficient and secure.</li>

                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The RBI's decision to stop the use of Rs. 2000
                                notes also has a number of negative implications. First, it will inconvenience people
                                who still use cash for everyday transactions. Second, it could lead to a rise in prices,
                                as businesses pass on the costs of complying with the new regulations to consumers.
                                Third, it could make it more difficult for people to access financial services, as some
                                banks may be reluctant to serve customers who do not have a bank account.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Multiple Points of View</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">There are a number of different points of view on
                                the RBI's decision to stop the use of Rs. 2000 notes. Some people believe that it is a
                                necessary step to combat crime and corruption. Others believe that it is an unnecessary
                                inconvenience that will hurt the poor and the vulnerable. Still others believe that it
                                is a step towards the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Possible Future Scenarios</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is difficult to say what the long-term
                                implications of the RBI's decision to stop the use of Rs. 2000 notes will be. However,
                                it is possible that it will lead to a number of changes in the way that people use and
                                manage their money. For example, it could lead to a rise in the use of digital payments,
                                as people look for more convenient and secure ways to pay for goods and services. It
                                could also lead to a change in the way that businesses operate, as they adapt to the new
                                regulations.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Is this a Step Closer to the Advent of CBDC
                                    in India?</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">It is possible that the RBI's decision to stop the
                                use of Rs. 2000 notes is a step closer to the introduction of a CBDC in India. A CBDC is
                                a digital currency that is issued by a central bank. It is similar to cash, but it can
                                be used online and in stores. The introduction of a CBDC could have a number of
                                benefits, including reducing the cost of cash transactions, making it easier for people
                                to access financial services, and improving the efficiency of the payments system.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">However, there are also a number of risks
                                associated with the introduction of a CBDC, including the potential for cyber-attacks
                                and the possibility that it could be used for illegal activities. The RBI will need to
                                carefully consider these risks before deciding whether or not to introduce a CBDC in
                                India.</li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Overall, the RBI's decision to stop the use of Rs.
                                2000 notes is a significant development that has the potential to have a major impact on
                                the Indian economy. It is too early to say what the long-term implications of this
                                decision will be, but it is clear that it is a move that will have far-reaching
                                consequences.</li>

                        <p class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The five steps to adopting a frugal lifestyle that can
                            help anyone achieve financial freedom within 10-15 years:</p>
                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>01. Create a Budget and Track
                                    Expenses</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Start by creating a detailed budget that outlines
                                your income and expenses. Track your spending to identify areas where you can cut back
                                and save. Keep track of your expenses daily. Nowadays simple mobile app will help you do
                                this very easily. You just need the discipline to enter data daily. By understanding
                                your financial situation and being mindful of your expenses, you can prioritize saving
                                and direct your money towards achieving your long-term financial goals.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>02. Embrace Minimalism and Prioritize Needs
                                    over Wants</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Adopting a minimalist mindset can be powerful in
                                cultivating a frugal lifestyle. Differentiate between needs and wants, and focus on
                                meeting your essential needs while minimizing unnecessary expenses. Prioritize
                                experiences, relationships, and personal growth over material possessions, which often
                                come with ongoing costs and maintenance. With so many offers to shop continuously, this
                                is probably the most valued skill for your wealth creation.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>03. Reduce Debt and Avoid New Debt</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Debt can hinder your progress towards financial
                                freedom. Make a plan to reduce and eliminate high-interest debt, such as credit card
                                debt, as quickly as possible. Avoid taking on new debt unless it's for appreciating
                                assets. By reducing debt, you free up more income to save and invest for your future.
                                For most people, the home loan debt forms around 25% to 35% of their income and is one
                                major reason why they never manage to get rich in life.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>04. Cut Expenses and Find Ways to

                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Review your regular expenses and find areas where
                                you can cut back. Look for opportunities to save on utilities, transportation,
                                groceries, and entertainment. Consider negotiating better deals on services, buying in
                                bulk, or using coupons and discounts. Small savings can add up significantly over time.
                                It is observed that most people manage their jobs or businesses very professionally, but
                                when it comes to managing their own money, they lack the professionalism and rigor.</li>

                                invests in them. The primary reason being lack of knowledge. People carry a number of

                        <ul class="fade-up mt-3">
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;"> In a world of material excess and constant
                                consumerism, the concept of minimalism offers a refreshing alternative. Embracing a
                                minimalist lifestyle entails living with less, reducing clutter, and prioritizing
                                experiences over material possessions. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, minimalism can be a
                                powerful tool for achieving financial freedom. By making conscious choices about what we
                                truly value, we can break free from the cycle of consumerism and create a life of
                                financial stability and peace.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Living with Less:</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Minimalism encourages individuals to declutter
                                their lives, both physically and mentally. By eliminating unnecessary possessions, we
                                gain a clearer perspective on what truly matters to us. Instead of accumulating material
                                items that often lose their value over time, minimalists focus on quality rather than
                                quantity. This deliberate choice to live with less not only saves money in the long run,
                                but it also reduces the burden of constantly maintaining and organizing excessive
                                belongings.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Reducing Financial Stress: </strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Adopting a minimalist lifestyle can alleviate
                                financial stress. When we reduce our expenses and prioritize our needs over our wants,
                                we create a sense of financial stability. By living within our means and avoiding
                                unnecessary debt, we can build a solid foundation for our financial future. The
                                financial freedom gained through minimalism provides the opportunity to save, invest,
                                and pursue our passions without the constant worry of financial constraints.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Prioritizing Experiences:</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">Minimalism encourages us to shift our focus from
                                accumulating possessions to cherishing experiences. Rather than chasing the latest
                                gadgets or designer labels, minimalists invest their time and resources in creating
                                memories and pursuing meaningful relationships. By prioritizing experiences over
                                material possessions, we find greater joy and fulfillment in the intangible aspects of
                                life. This shift not only reduces our financial burden but also enriches our lives with
                                moments that hold lasting value.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3" style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></li>
                            <li class="mt-2" style="color: #3d3d3d;">The minimalist lifestyle offers a path to financial
                                freedom by embracing simplicity and prioritizing what truly matters. By consciously
                                living with less, reducing clutter, and valuing experiences over material possessions,
                                we free ourselves from the pressure of consumerism and achieve a sense of contentment
                                and financial stability. Adopting a minimalist mindset allows us to live within our
                                means, reduce financial stress, and focus on building a life of purpose and fulfillment.
                                Embracing minimalism is not just about decluttering our homes; it is about freeing
                                ourselves from the endless pursuit of material possessions and embracing a simpler,more
                                meaningful existence.</li>
