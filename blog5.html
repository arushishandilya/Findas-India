                <p class="text-muted mb-4"><i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>May 7, 2023</p>

                <p class="text-secondary">It is not important how much money you earn. What is
                            more important is that how much of it do you save and even more critical is how much of that
                            money works really hard for you!</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3">Your ability to do this in your life is a function of
                            what money software you run in your brain. Over the years I have been working on my own
                            money software or my money blueprint, because of which I have been able to life the live
                            that I love. Today I will share some of the important components of my money thinking with
                            you. Read on.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3"><strong>Spending on my passion –</strong> a few decades
                            back, I used to spend randomly, without any specific intention. It was like my friends
                            bought a bike, so I must buy one. Its Diwali time, so I must buy new clothes – even if I
                            have a lot that I don’t even use. It was more like compulsive shopping either out of peer
                            pressure or circumstantial. But once I went over all my spending for a year, and realized
                            that not everything I buy is useful or makes me happy. That’s when I linked my major
                            spending to my passion – which is food and travel. Now I spend very intentionally. I keep my
                            spending low on things that are essential but are not closely linked to my passion. For
                            example, I will always buy clothes only at a sale. Or I always buy a second hand car that is
                            used just under a year. So, my idea is to keep expenses low on items that are delivering low
                            value, but are essential for living decent life. But when it comes to travelling, I usually
                            take 2 long vacations every year. One is a 25 to 30 day vacation in some foreign country and
                            another is a 15-20 day trekking break usually in the Himalayas. By reducing my spending on
                            things that deliver low value and continuing to spend money on things that are really
                            important, it helps me balance out my life and does not create a feeling of being deprived
                            of something. In fact when I spend on my passion, it keeps me charged for the rest of the
                            year.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3"><strong>Buy Quality –</strong> Few decades back I used
                            to believe in buying cheap. That was the time I was not really looking at the quality, but
                            just the price of things. The experience of life was that things used to get useless faster
                            and I was always shopping back again. Overtime I changed my habit from buying cheap to
                            buying quality. Now I have stopped compromising on quality, rather I give it first priority.
                            But I keep finding ways and means to buy quality at a lower price. For example I bought a
                            Samsung Note 9 – 500GB phone 2 years back. At the time of buying this phone was selling at
                            95000 on Amazon, but I got one at just 30000. It was from a reliable source and used for
                            just 4 months. This way I got quality at a lower price, serving my purpose. I realized that
                            paying for quality saves money on the long run.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3"><strong>Consciously Reducing lifestyle expenses
                                -</strong> The most common thing that happens is your expenses increase in proportion to
                            your income. I have been managing money for a few thousand clients since 1999 and I have
                            seen this happen in most cases. This was a great learning and I have converted it into a
                            habit for myself – I have been very intentional in reducing my lifestyle expenses over the
                            years. Not just maintaining the expenses, rather actually looking for ways to reduce them
                            consciously. This is what I call lifestyle optimization. This has made my life simpler and I
                            have been very contended. Another big thing that happened because of this is that my savings
                            rate has gone up drastically.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3"><strong>Keeping debt low -</strong> In today’s world, it
                            is easy to get a loan like never before. This makes people an easy prey for the finance
                            companies selling debt. Plus we are under constant pressure to look rich. So everyone is
                            more than eager to buy that dream house, dream car and dream vacation – all on loan. Most of
                            us believe that the price you pay for anything you buy is in currency or rupees.
                            Unfortunately this is half true. According to me the price is paid in terms of time, and not
                            money. So when you take up a housing loan for instance, for most people their EMI is on an
                            average 30% of their income. What it means is that for a 20 year tenure loan, one has to
                            work 6.5 years for the bank – to pay your EMI. For me this is a very BIG price to pay,
                            losing 6.5 years of my life for the bank. Hence I have managed to keep very low debt levels
                            in my life. Typically, my debt is less than 5% of my income. This gives me the freedom to
                            invest more money and also work less as I have a lower commitment that would trap me and
                            make someone else rich, the bank for instance.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary mt-3"><strong>Spend last, Safe first -</strong> This is
                            probably the most talked about rule in the world of money, pay yourself first. Unfortunately
                            most people know it, but do not follow it. I realized its importance way back in 2003 and
                            changed my mental money math accordingly. This is probably one of the most powerful rule of
                            money and it has worked exceedingly well for me over the years. Initially, I used to save at
                            the end of the month and had little left to save. Once I changed this and started saving at
                            the beginning, life has been much better since then. Now I not only save more but have more
                            money to spend also. It is almost like magic and cannot be explained unless you experience
                            it for yourself. This one habit will sky rocket your monthly saving in no time. Living the
                            life you love – it’s pretty simple if you form the correct money habits. Saving is no rocket
                            science, it’s just very basic common sense. By spending intentionally on things that add
                            value, you can save a lot by avoiding petty low value expenses. Just by buying quality items
                            that last longer, you can replace many cheap items. If you managed and reduce the fixed
                            costs of your lifestyle and also focus on increasing your income overtime, your saving with
                            increase manifold. Keeping debt levels low will keep money in your pocket leaving you with
                            more choices in life. Just by paying myself first, I have managed to turn my life around in
                            a matter of few years. This is the most powerful money habit you can ever develop.</p>               
                
                <p class="text-secondary mt-4">My secret to improving my finances is focusing on the
                            long term and develop money habits that work. Habits get developed over time, but once done
                            they keep you on track towards your financial goals. I hope you develop them and enjoy the
                            journey towards a financially abundant life.</p>
